### Biography
Here's a little about me

![](aaron-burden-y02jEX_B0O0-unsplash.jpg)

My name is Andres and writing is the way I experience life the best. Whether it be through books, music, films, 
short stories, or even verbal texts, writing opens up entirely new perspectives on the world.

Some of my favorite genres include horror/thrillers, science fiction, adventure and comedy. A few of my favorite
authors include Edgar Allan Poe, H.P. Lovecraft, Charles Bukowski, Stanley Kubrick, and Marcus Aurelius.

I hope to show you more of my love of poetry as well as learn new things along the way.
